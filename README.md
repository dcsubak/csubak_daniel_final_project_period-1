# csubak_daniel_final_project_period-1

This project is a recreation of the game Breakout, which is a game where a player bounces a ball to hit and destroy objects to win/complete the game.

## Description

The game itself Breakout was originally created in 1976 and was compatible with older game devices like Nintendo, Atari, and Game Boy. The game involves a sliding bar on the bottom of the screen where they can use it to prevent a ball that bounces from falling off the screen and disappearing. If the player successfully can redirect the ball using the slider, the ball will collide with the blocks above which have health points. Once the player hits said blocks with the ball, the block will be destroyed and if all blocks that are on the screen are killed, then the player has beaten the game.
